## Tests

Unfortunately we were not able to implement relevant testing in our app because we were more worried in delivering the features and we were still lacking time. We could only manage to do one or two simple unit tests that can be found in [test](../app/test). We did not manage to implement acceptance tests.

However, we are aware of the importance of testing and that will be certainly one of our main concerns in other future projects.
