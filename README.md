# _**ITFlow**_ Development Report

Welcome to the documentation pages of the _ITFlow_!

You can find here details about the product (or mini-app or module), from a high-level vision to low-level implementation decisions, a kind of Software Development Report, organized by discipline (as of Rational Unified Process): 

* Business modeling 
  * [Product Vision](/docs/ProductVision.md)
  * [Elevator Pitch](/docs/ElevatorPitch.md)
* [Requirements](/docs/requirements.md)
  * [Domain model](/docs/requirements.md)
* [Architecture and Design](/docs/ArchitectureAndDesign.md)
  * [Logical architecture](/docs/ArchitectureAndDesign.md#logical-architecture)
  * [Physical architecture](/docs/ArchitectureAndDesign.md#physical-architecture)
  * [Vertical prototype](/docs/ArchitectureAndDesign.md#vertical-prototype)
* [Implementation]
* [Test]
* [Configuration and change management]

So far, contributions are exclusively made by the initial team, but we hope to open them to the community, in all areas and topics: requirements, technologies, development, experimentation, testing, etc.
